<p>CASE STUDY: MapReduce</p>
<p>Let's talk about MapReduce (MR) as a case study<br>
a good illustration of 6.824's main topics<br>
hugely influential<br>
the focus of Lab 1</p>
<p>MapReduce overview<br>
context: multi-hour computations on multi-terabyte data-sets<br>
e.g. build search index, or sort, or analyze structure of web<br>
only practical with 1000s of computers<br>
applications not written by distributed systems experts<br>
overall goal: easy for non-specialist programmers<br>
programmer just defines Map and Reduce functions<br>
often fairly simple sequential code<br>
MR takes care of, and hides, all aspects of distribution!</p>
<p>Abstract view of a MapReduce job<br>
input is (already) split into M files<br>
Input1 -&gt; Map -&gt; a,1 b,1<br>
Input2 -&gt; Map -&gt;     b,1<br>
Input3 -&gt; Map -&gt; a,1     c,1<br>
|   |   |<br>
|   |   -&gt; Reduce -&gt; c,1<br>
|   -----&gt; Reduce -&gt; b,2<br>
---------&gt; Reduce -&gt; a,2<br>
MR calls Map() for each input file, produces set of k2,v2<br>
&quot;intermediate&quot; data<br>
each Map() call is a &quot;task&quot;<br>
MR gathers all intermediate v2's for a given k2,<br>
and passes each key + values to a Reduce call<br>
final output is set of &lt;k2,v3&gt; pairs from Reduce()s</p>
<p>Example: word count<br>
input is thousands of text files<br>
Map(k, v)<br>
split v into words<br>
for each word w<br>
emit(w, &quot;1&quot;)<br>
Reduce(k, v)<br>
emit(len(v))</p>
<p>MapReduce scales well:<br>
N &quot;worker&quot; computers get you Nx throughput.<br>
Maps()s can run in parallel, since they don't interact.<br>
Same for Reduce()s.<br>
So you can get more throughput by buying more computers.</p>
<p>MapReduce hides many details:<br>
sending app code to servers<br>
tracking which tasks are done<br>
moving data from Maps to Reduces<br>
balancing load over servers<br>
recovering from failures</p>
<p>However, MapReduce limits what apps can do:<br>
No interaction or state (other than via intermediate output).<br>
No iteration, no multi-stage pipelines.<br>
No real-time or streaming processing.</p>
<p>Input and output are stored on the GFS cluster file system<br>
MR needs huge parallel input and output throughput.<br>
GFS splits files over many servers, in 64 MB chunks<br>
Maps read in parallel<br>
Reduces write in parallel<br>
GFS also replicates each file on 2 or 3 servers<br>
Having GFS is a big win for MapReduce</p>
<p>What will likely limit the performance?<br>
We care since that's the thing to optimize.<br>
CPU? memory? disk? network?<br>
In 2004 authors were limited by network capacity.<br>
What does MR send over the network?<br>
Maps read input from GFS.<br>
Reduces read Map output.<br>
Can be as large as input, e.g. for sorting.<br>
Reduces write output files to GFS.<br>
[diagram: servers, tree of network switches]<br>
In MR's all-to-all shuffle, half of traffic goes through root switch.<br>
Paper's root switch: 100 to 200 gigabits/second, total<br>
1800 machines, so 55 megabits/second/machine.<br>
55 is small, e.g. much less than disk or RAM speed.<br>
Today: networks and root switches are much faster relative to CPU/disk.</p>
<p>Some details (paper's Figure 1):<br>
one master, that hands out tasks to workers and remembers progress.</p>
<ol>
<li>master gives Map tasks to workers until all Maps complete<br>
Maps write output (intermediate data) to local disk<br>
Maps split output, by hash, into one file per Reduce task</li>
<li>after all Maps have finished, master hands out Reduce tasks<br>
each Reduce fetches its intermediate output from (all) Map workers<br>
each Reduce task writes a separate output file on GFS</li>
</ol>
<p>How does MR minimize network use?<br>
Master tries to run each Map task on GFS server that stores its input.<br>
All computers run both GFS and MR workers<br>
So input is read from local disk (via GFS), not over network.<br>
Intermediate data goes over network just once.<br>
Map worker writes to local disk.<br>
Reduce workers read directly from Map workers, not via GFS.<br>
Intermediate data partitioned into files holding many keys.<br>
R is much smaller than the number of keys.<br>
Big network transfers are more efficient.</p>
<p>How does MR get good load balance?<br>
Wasteful and slow if N-1 servers have to wait for 1 slow server to finish.<br>
But some tasks likely take longer than others.<br>
Solution: many more tasks than workers.<br>
Master hands out new tasks to workers who finish previous tasks.<br>
So no task is so big it dominates completion time (hopefully).<br>
So faster servers do more tasks than slower ones, finish abt the same time.</p>
<p>What about fault tolerance?<br>
I.e. what if a worker crashes during a MR job?<br>
We want to completely hide failures from the application programmer!<br>
Does MR have to re-run the whole job from the beginning?<br>
Why not?<br>
MR re-runs just the failed Map()s and Reduce()s.<br>
Suppose MR runs a Map twice, one Reduce sees first run's output,<br>
another Reduce sees the second run's output?<br>
Correctness requires re-execution to yield exactly the same output.<br>
So Map and Reduce must be pure deterministic functions:<br>
they are only allowed to look at their arguments.<br>
no state, no file I/O, no interaction, no external communication.<br>
What if you wanted to allow non-functional Map or Reduce?<br>
Worker failure would require whole job to be re-executed,<br>
or you'd need to create synchronized global checkpoints.</p>
<p>Details of worker crash recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map worker crashes:<br>
master notices worker no longer responds to pings<br>
master knows which Map tasks it ran on that worker<br>
those tasks' intermediate output is now lost, must be re-created<br>
master tells other workers to run those tasks<br>
can omit re-running if Reduces already fetched the intermediate data</li>
<li>Reduce worker crashes.<br>
finished tasks are OK -- stored in GFS, with replicas.<br>
master re-starts worker's unfinished tasks on other workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other failures/problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the master gives two workers the same Map() task?<br>
perhaps the master incorrectly thinks one worker died.<br>
it will tell Reduce workers about only one of them.</li>
<li>What if the master gives two workers the same Reduce() task?<br>
they will both try to write the same output file on GFS!<br>
atomic GFS rename prevents mixing; one complete file will be visible.</li>
<li>What if a single worker is very slow -- a &quot;straggler&quot;?<br>
perhaps due to flakey hardware.<br>
master starts a second copy of last few tasks.</li>
<li>What if a worker computes incorrect output, due to broken h/w or s/w?<br>
too bad! MR assumes &quot;fail-stop&quot; CPUs and software.</li>
<li>What if the master crashes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Current status?<br>
Hugely influential (Hadoop, Spark, &amp;c).<br>
Probably no longer in use at Google.<br>
Replaced by Flume / FlumeJava (see paper by Chambers et al).<br>
GFS replaced by Colossus (no good description), and BigTable.</p>
<p>Conclusion<br>
MapReduce single-handedly made big cluster computation popular.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not the most efficient or flexible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scales well.</li>
<li>Easy to program -- failures and data movement are hidden.<br>
These were good trade-offs in practice.<br>
We'll see some more advanced successors later in the course.<br>
Have fun with the lab!</li>
